Hey, it's Austin!
</h1>

<p>
I'm a student at Penn State University, hoping to make it big in this world.<br>
I have a massive passion for technology, and I've always taken a liking towards programming.<br>
I hope you enjoy this site I made about myself. I see it as a step in the right direction.</p>

<p> 
I'm an intern at #### and I work everyday to try to push the techworld further along.<br>
I'm also the owner and head scripter of a game called Fracture, which is based on Roblox.<br>
The game focuses on immersion, world building, combat, and exploration, with one of the core <br>
game mechanics being permanent character loss.
